      The 2018 NLG Tech Summit is focused on <span class="boldSpan">Pillar III of the NLG initiative: Adolescents & Youth</span>. Over one third of Syrian and Iraqi refugees are between 10 and 24 years old - there is an entire generation of young people living through conflict, displacement and the repercussions across the region. These young people are critical to building the future of the region, but they need our support to access education, dignified livelihoods, to participate in society and to rebuild their communities.
